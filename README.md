# (ARCHIVE) Batch Examples
A collection of short programs written in Batch, made by me in 2019/2020. I made these out of curiosity of the limits of `.bat` files and to learn some Windows terminal commands, also to see how older terminal-based applications would've been made.

## Contents:
| **Project** | **Date** | **Description** |
|--|--|--|
| game.bat | 22/04/2020 | Micro programs, such as a password generator, matrix code generator, number guessing game, etc. |
| matrix.bat | 18/05/2019 | Simple Matrix-inspired code effect |
| matrix2.bat | 18/05/2019 | Another simple Matrix-inspired code effect |
| rainbow.bat | 13/10/2019 | Demonstration of colours available in the terminal |
